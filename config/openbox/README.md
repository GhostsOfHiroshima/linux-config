## Autostart file

Should be placed in `~/.config/openbox`

## Compton config

Place this in `~/.config`

---------

The default config file that came with compton gave me some trouble.

Bookmark folders in firefox not opening, and right click not working either.

Found a config file [here](http://duncanlock.net/blog/2013/06/07/how-to-switch-to-compton-for-beautiful-tear-free-compositing-in-xfce/) which works great


## Misc

Obconf theme - `Fog-i`
Lxappearence - `Simple-Industrial`
